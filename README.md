# 🎵 Digital Music Store Analysis – SQL Project for Beginners

## 📌 Objective

This project is designed for beginners to learn and practice SQL by analyzing a digital music store's database.  
Using SQL queries, we uncover key business insights that can help the store understand customer behavior, music preferences, and overall business growth.
